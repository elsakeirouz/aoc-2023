# Advent of Code 2023.

It is my first time doing the AOC, and I am doing it in Rust every single day because it is a language I want to learn.

Hopefully by the 25th I will have some substantial knowledge and will be able to utilize the language in the way it is
designed to be used, in order to make the most out of its features (with as little googling as possible, haha).
